⚾️🩸📈🐟 `blasefishymon` : Watch Blaseball using `bubblefishymon`
=============================================================

# Why did you do this?

[Submitted as part of the first Official SIBR Hackathon](https://cursed.sibr.dev/). The brief was "What is the most cursed way to watch a Blaseball game?"


# What do all these bits mean????

 - Water level depends on how much physical and virtual memory is used by the system.
 - CPU activity makes water "boil" and creates bubbles.
 - CPU meter near the bottom shows actual value in percent.
 - As bases are occupied, water level goes up.
 - When system runs out of physical memory and begins using swap, both water and air colors change depending on amount of swap used.
 - There is a cute yellow duck swimming from one corner of the dockapp to another. The duck really doesn't do anything at the moment,
