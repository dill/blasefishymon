⚾️🩸📈🐟 `blasefishymon` : Watch Blaseball using `bubblefishymon`
=============================================================

# Why did you do this?

[Submitted as part of the first Official SIBR Hackathon](https://cursed.sibr.dev/). The brief was "What is the most cursed way to watch a Blaseball game?"


# What do all these bits mean????

 - Water level depends on how much physical and virtual memory is used by the system.
 - CPU activity makes water "boil" and creates bubbles.
 - Text at the bottom shows odds for the team.
 - As bases are occupied, water level goes up.
 - When more blases are occupied than exist (this is Blaseball, afterall), both water and air colors change.
 - There is a cute yellow duck swimming from one side to another. The duck really doesn't do anything.
